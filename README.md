# Cart app

Simple application providing a catalog of articles in categories and a cart.

App uses the Digifood private API to retrieve categories and article from a selected store.

The Digifood API endpoint has been reversed engineered from the "Puy Du Fou" Android application.

There is no extra setup required to run the app on an Android simulator.
